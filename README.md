User Registration: Secure password storage with SHA-256 hashing, email confirmation, unique ID generation, and creation of a home directory.
Authentication & Logout: Validates users, tracks last login, and maintains a list of logged-in users.
Reporting: Generates asynchronous reports per user with number of files, directories, and disk usage in their home directory.
Text Processing: Utilizes sed for all text operations to manipulate CSV user data.
